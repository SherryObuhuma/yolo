# Overview
This project involves the containerization and deployment of a full-stack yolo application using Docker. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to set up and containerize both frontend and backend using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and scalability. The backend interacts with a MongoDB database, and product data added through the e-commerce form is persisted across container restarts using Docker volumes.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for adding products
- Persistent MongoDB database for storing product data
- Containerized backend and frontend using Docker and Docker Compose
- Automatic setup of MongoDB, backend, and frontend services via Docker Compose
- Products added via the e-commerce form are stored in MongoDB and persist across container restarts

## Prerequisites
To run this application locally, you must have the following installed:
- Docker
- Git

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Build and run the containers
3. Access the application
4. Verify data persistence
5. Tag and push the images to Docker Hub
6. Document all the steps taken in the implementation of the project in the explanation.md file
